Abstract
 
Crveno jezero (Red Lake) is one of the largest karstic sinkhole lakes in the Europe. Diatom flora of this lake was unknown due to difficulties in collecting samples. Recently, samples were collected by speleodivers in the frame of systematical natural sciences research, during the cave diving expedition “Crveno jezero 2017” and observations revealed the existence of a new species, Gomphosphenia plenkoviciae Gligora Udovič & Žutinić sp. nov. The species is described herein as new to science based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Gomphosphenia plenkoviciae is characterized by having narrowly clavate to linear valves, which are slightly heteropolar in larger specimens to clavate in smaller specimens, thus differing from the closest taxon by the valve outline and shape of the central area. Smaller valves of G. plenkoviciae differ from other small-sized Gomphosphenia species by valve outline, striae morphology and the shape of axial and central areas.

Introduction
 
The genus Gomphosphenia Lange-Bertalot (1995: 243) was separated from Gomphonema Ehrenberg (1832: 87) by several ultrastructural features, such as external and internal raphe structure, striae and areolae morphology, absence of apical pore field, absence of isolated stigma. When established, it was considered a species limited genus with 17 taxa including species and varieties (Guiry & Guiry 2018). Lately, several new species from different parts of the world have been described and included into the genus: G. fontinalis Lange-Bertalot, Ector & Werum (in Werum & Lange-Bertalot 2004: 163, figs 94: 1–16), G. stoermeri Kociolek & E.W.Thomas (in Thomas et al. 2009: 230, figs 127–141), G. tenuis Levkov & D.M.Williams (2011: 20, figs 131–139, 161–171), G. americana Kociolek & E.Thomas (in Kociolek et al. 2014: 45, figs 65: 1–6), G. indistincta Kociolek & E.Thomas (in Kociolek et al. 2014: 46, figs 65: figs 7–16), G. praegnans J.A.Ress, E.W.Thomas & Kociolek (2016: 56, 57, figs 27–44), G. ryukyuensis A.Tuji & Ohtsuka (in Tuji 2016: 2, figs 1–18), G. biwaensis Ohtsuka & D.Nakai (in Ohtsuka et al. 2018, figs 4–22, 27–30). Gomphosphenia species have been reported to occur in diverse types of habitats, like rivers (Van de Vijver et al. 2012), lakes (Genkal & Yarushina 2016, Ohtsuka et al. 2018) and even extreme habitats like drainage channels of dams (Noga et al. 2016). Moreover, Gomphosphenia grovei (M.Schmidt) Lange-Bertalot (1995: 243) was recorded in the core DEEP-5045-1 from Lake Ohrid (Jovanovska & Cvetkoska pers. comm.), aged around 1.3 million years (Wagner et al. 2017). In most cases, Gomphosphenia was observed from cold oligotrophic and alkaline waters, although some species, for instance G. fontinalis or G. lingulatiformis, might occur in eutrophic habitats (Krammer & Lange-Bertalot 1986, Werum & Lange-Bertalot 2004, Hofmann et al. 2013).
 None of the species from the genus Gomphosphenia have yet been recorded in Croatia, whilst G. lingulatiformis (Lange-Bertalot & E. Reichardt) Lange Bertalot (1995: 242, figs 4: figs 1–4) was recorded from karstic springs in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Dedić et al. 2015). Observations of sediments from lake Crveno jezero reveal presence of one unknown Gomphosphenia species with a variable abundance at different depths. Species has unique morphometric characteristics clearly differentiating from the other known species. Description of a new Gomphosphenia species with a formal diagnosis is provided herein.
Material and methods
 
Crveno jezero (Red Lake) is a karstic sinkhole lake at the town of Imotski in Croatia, near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina (Fig. 1). The total maximal depth of Red Lake is -526.9 m, with a bottom at -4 m a.s.l., water line between 232 to 311 m a.s.l., surface of 2.7 ha and maximal water accumulation of 8.24 x 106 m3 (Andrić & Bonacci 2015). The name of lake originates from reddish colour of the iron oxide imprinted into carbonate rocks forming a steep water well-like structure (Ozimec 1999, Aspacher et al. 2000). Red Lake is one of the most impressive karst landform in Dinaric mountains and one of the largest sinkholes in the world, most likely formed by the collapse of a large cave hall. Due to its unique geomorphological features and exceptional value, in 1964 it was protected as a natural monument (IUCN Category III), and was included into the Ecological network NATURA 2000 since 2014 (HR2000934).
 
Figure 1. Location of Crveno jezero.
 The temperature of water during sampling was ranging from 15°C at the surface to 9.4°C at the bottom. Annual precipitation of the area is around 1500 mm (Meteorological and hydrological service of Croatia 2016).
 Sampling of phytobenthos was conducted as part of systematical natural sciences research organized during the International speleodiving expedition “Crveno jezero 2017”, on the 5th and 6th of May 2017, when the first ever successful dive to the bottom of lake was achieved (Ozimec et al. 2017). Sediment was collected from the lateral balcony at the east side of the Red Lake at water depths of -20 m and at the bottom of the lake -245 m by a professional speleodiver and stored in plastic containers. Upon completing the dive, sediment was relocated in smaller plastic containers (120 mL) and fixed with a 2% final concentration formaldehyde solution. Diatoms were cleaned using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) following the instructions of the European Standard (EN 13946:2014). Permanent microscope diatom slides were prepared with Naprax® as a mountant and analyzed under oil immersion at x1500 magnification with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon Inc., Japan). Photomicrographs from light microscope (LM) were taken with a Nikon Coolpix P6000 camera (Nikon Inc., Japan). For scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations, the material was filtered, air dried (Whatman filters, 3 μm pore size; Merck KGaA, Germany) and attached by carbon tape to the sample holder. The samples were sputter coated with about 15 nm layer of platinum using the Precision Etching and Coating System, PECS II (Gatan Inc., CA, USA). Morphology of diatoms was examined using JSM-7800F SEM microscope (Jeol Ltd., Japan). SEM images were recorded at a working distance (WD) of 10 mm with the electron beam voltage of 5 kV.

Frustules in girdle view wedge-shaped (Figs 38, 57, 58). Valves are narrowly clavate to linear and slightly heteropolar in larger specimens to clavate in smaller specimens (Figs 2–36, 43–56). Longer specimens have undulated valve margin and an inflated central part, smaller valves are with convex margins. Headpole rounded, non-protracted, slightly narrower than mid-valve, footpole acutely rounded. Widest part in larger specimens is near the mid-valve, smaller specimens are widest in the upper valve half. Valves are 12–45 μm long and 3.0–6.5 μm wide. Axial area in larger specimens is rather wide, lanceolate, widening towards central area (Figs 2–36); in smaller specimens rather narrow, slightly widened near the central area (Figs 43–56). Central area wide, clearly separated from axial area. Raphe is clearly visible, straight with small, indistinct proximal endings (Figs 37, 39, 40, 60). Internally, the proximal raphe endings are T-shaped (Figs 41, 42, 62). Distal raphe endings externally are very short, straight, slightly expanded into drop-like pores (Figs 37, 39, 40) and not passing on the valve mantle, while internally terminating with distinct helictoglossae (Figs 41, 42, 61). Transapical striae weakly radiate, becoming almost parallel towards poles, 19–22 striae in 10 μm. Striae terminate at the edge of the valve face, and do not extend onto the mantle (Figs 37, 39, 40, 59). Each stria is composed of a single areola. Externally, areolae in the mid-valve have round shape, while towards poles become slightly elongated slits. Internally, areolae appear longer than externally and are covered by fine hymenate occlusions (Figs 40, 61, 62). Two types of striae on the valve mantle were observed. In some specimens (Fig. 57) striae are composed of few (2–4) round areolae, while in other specimens mantle striae are composed of a single areola with slit-like opening (Figs 38, 58, 59). Girdle composed of several open bands (Fig. 38, 57, 58), each bearing a single row of round pores. At footpole, septa, pseudosepta and apical pore field are absent.
 Etymology: This species is named in honour of Prof. Anđelka Plenković-Moraj, leading professor in freshwater ecology and phycology at the Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb.
 Distribution: Gomphosphenia plenkoviciae is so far known from Crveno jezero and Krka River. Both localities represent typical karstic environments with high content of CaCO3 and high conductivity.

Discussion
 
Gomphosphenia plenkoviciae possesses typical morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of Gomphosphenia. There are few species comparable to G. plenkoviciae in relation to valve size and shape (Table 1). Gomphosphenia holmquistii (Foged) Lange-Bertalot (1995: 244) = Gomphonema holmquistii Foged (1968: 8, fig. 3: 3) appears similar in valve size and length. Foged (1968) provides a very narrow range for valve size of G. holmquistii in the type material (33–36 μm long, 5–6 μm wide, with 18–20 striae per 10 μm). Recently, Noga et al. (2016) presented a broader valve size range (13.4–29.3 μm long, 3.2–4.8 μm wide, with 19–22 striae per 10 μm) that is comparable to G. plenkoviciae (15–45 μm long and 4.3–6.5 μm wide). Both species also share similar ultrastructural features as stria, areola raphe and girdle bands structure. However, both species can be easily differentiated by the valve shape. Gomphosphenia holmquistii is club-shaped in outline with convex valve margins. In G. plenkoviciae valve margins are undulate, which is especially expressed in the larger and medium-sized specimens. The widest part of the valve is at the centre, with valve margin becoming concave towards apices. The headpole is narrowly rounded in larger specimens opposite to round headpole in G. holmquistii. The central area in G. holmquistii is broad and cannot be separated from the axial area, while in G. plenkoviciae it is clearly separated and wider than the axial area.
 Another species that might be substituted for G. plenkoviciae is G. tenuis Levkov & Williams (2011: 20, figs 131–139, 161–171; Table 1). Gomphosphenia tenuis is characterized by club-shaped valves 22–42 µm long, 3.5–6.2 µm wide with 14–16 striae in 10 µm and central area a broad unilateral fascia. Similarly as in G. holmquistii, valve margins in G. tenuis are convex, tapering towards the broadly rounded headpole. Both species can be easily differentiated by the valve shape, stria density (19–22 vs 14–16 striae in 10 µm in G. tenuis) and shape of the central area (unilateral fascia in G. tenuis).

 Gomphosphenia lingulatiformis (Lange-Bertalot & Reichardt) Lange-Bertalot (1995: 242) = Gomphonema lingulatiforme Lange-Bertalot and Reichardt (in Lange-Bertalot (1993: 60–61; figs 83: 1–11) also has comparable morphological features with G. plenkoviciae, possessing linear-clavate with slightly undulate valve margins and nearly acute headpole. However, both species can be easily differentiated by shape of the central area, which is consistently wider in G. lingulatiformis than G. plenkoviciae for any given valve length, and has coarser striae with a lower density (13–18 striae in 10 µm in G. lingulatiformis).
 Gomphosphenia grovei (M. Schmidt) Lange-Bertalot (1995: 243) = Gomphonema grovei M. Schmidt (in Schmidt et al. 1874–1959, figs 214: 13–18) has larger valves (length 15–70 µm, width 8–11 µm) with broadly clavate outline and punctate striae composed of two areolae 10–12 in 10 µm). These features make its differentiation from G. plenkoviciae fairly simple. Gomphosphenia ryukyuensis Tuji & Ohtsuka (in Tuji 2016: 2, figs 1–18) has comparable valve width as G. plenkoviciae, but different valve shape (clavate with broadly rounded headpole and slightly rostrate footpole) and striae clearly punctate, composed of two areolae (Table 1).
 There are several Gomphosphenia taxa that have comparable valve size with smaller specimens of G. plenkoviciae (Table 1). Gomphosphenia paradoxa Lange-Bertalot (1995: 246) has similar valve outline and size as G. plenkoviciae, but it differs by several morphological and ultrastructural features. Gomphosphenia paradoxa is characterized by the presence of distinct pseudosepta, clearly visible with LM. Proximal raphe endings are distantly spaced and distinctly expanded externally, while internally are simple and slightly deflected. Striae are strongly radiate in the mid-valve becoming parallel to convergent towards apices, 25–32 in 10 μm. Gomphosphenia fontinalis Lange-Bertalot, Ector & Werum (in Werum & Lange-Bertalot 2004: 163) is a small-celled species with club-shaped valves that are 5–8 μm long, 1.5–2.3 μm wide, with densely spaced striae (25–32 in 10 μm) and unilaterally hooked internal central raphe endings. These features make its differentiation from G. plenkoviciae simple. Gomphosphenia stoermeri Kociolek & E.W.Thomas (in Thomas et al. 2009: 230) has similar size and comparable valve outline to G. plenkoviciae, but both species can be differentiated by the shape of axial area, proximal raphe endings and stria density (28–35 in 10 μm in G. stoermeri). Gomphosphenia praegnans J.A. Ress, E.W. Thomas & Kociolek (2016: 56, 57) has valves which are broadly lanceolate-clavate with protracted rostrate head- and footpoles that clearly differentiate from G. plenkoviciae. Gomphosphenia americana Kociolek & E.W. Thomas (in Kociolek et al. 2014: 45) is characterized by smaller valves (9.0–15.0 μm long and 2.2–3.0 μm wide), very narrow axial area and a small central area. Opposite to G. plenkoviciae, internal proximal raphe endings in G. americana are simple, deflected to the same side and not T-shaped.
